A PyTorch implementation of a multi-condition fusion model for semantic segmentation of autonomous driving scenes under varying weather conditions
The model dynamically aggregates features from different weather inputs, enforces cross-condition consistency, and decodes fused features with multi-scale attention.

Requirements
Python 3.8+
